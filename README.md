#Lubmerjack Trees
Cut down whole trees and keep the stump intact.

The mod is made that it works for most tree mods (if they other modders append their logs to the minecraft log tags)
So palm trees and the likes should be compatible.

Inspiration taken from the TreeCapitator mod!
When I created the mod their was no support for the version 1.5.2 with forge, that is the main reason I created this mod.
